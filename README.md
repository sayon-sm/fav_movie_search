# Favorite Movie Search

###### The user must fill out all the fields provided. Otherwise, an alert appears.

###### Then, click the "ADD MOVIE" button. This adds the data (from the input fields) to a list below the UI and also clears the input fields.

###### The user can enter a single letter or a word, then click the "SEARCH" button. If a match is found, the list displays all matching movies; otherwise, an alert appears and the list displays all the movies added.

###### The search is performed through the title (Favorite Movie) of the movies.
